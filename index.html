										Our project addresses a fundamental challenge in financial markets: accurately predicting short-term stock price movements. 
										While traditional approaches like technical analysis only rely on historical patterns, they often fail to capture sudden market shifts triggered by breaking news and ever-changing market sentiment.
										However, solely relying on market sentiment assumes high risk due to the subjective and biased nature of certain sentiment.
									</p>
									<p>
										To bridge this gap, we developed an approach that combines both technical analysis with a sophisticated news headline sentiment analysis scorer to serve as inputs for a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices. 
										By leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, our model captures the impact of realtime news on stock prices, enabling more precise market timing decisions.

									<h3>Data Sources</h3>
									<p>Our study focused on a carefully selected set of stocks across four key market sectors:
										Technology, Healthcare, Energy, and Consumer Defensive. These sectors were chosen to
										minimize correlation and overlap, ensuring a diverse representation of market dynamics.
										Within each sector, we specifically chose companies with above-median market capitalization.
										For ample diversity, we selected 15 stocks that met this threshold, with only the
										Energy sector that had 11 companies above the median. This criterion was used to concentrate
										on companies that attract significant media attention and maintain enough trading
										volume for reliable price discovery. This ultimately helped address potential data sparsity
										issues that could arise with smaller, less-covered companies, where infrequent news
										mentions and price movements might be more influenced by liquidity constraints than by
										information flows.</p>

									<p>The data in our project required a comprehensive collection of both real-time news headlines
										and financial market data. We established a systematic data acquisition strategy to
										scrape news article titles and utilized Yahoo Finance’s API for technical analysis.
									</p>
									<p>We implemented an automated web scraping framework to collect news headlines from
										five major news outlets: The New York Times, CNN, Stat News, Associated Press, and ABC
										News. The Python-based web scraping framework is built using BeautifulSoup and Request
										libraries. It was executed at 30-minute intervals during standard market trading hours
										(9:30 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time) to simulate real-time information processing
										capabilities that would be available to traders. As such, the time of scraping was also stored
										to be used in training the model. The data collection period extended from January 22,
										2025, through February 28, 2025, encompassing 26 trading days. In total, we gathered
										over 14,600 unique headlines: 7,093 from the Associated Press, 4,280 from CNN, 1,923
										from The New York Times, 923 from ABC News, and 413 from Stat News.</p>
									<p>The technical analysis data for our study is built on a variety of indicators that capture
										different market trends and price behaviors. Using the Yahoo Finance API through the yfinance Python library, we systematically collected daily stock data for each selected company
										from January 1, 2024, to February 26, 2025. The data includes standard stock metrics
										such as daily opening and closing prices, as well as intraday price movements and trading
										volumes.</p>
									<p>Key indicators derived from this data include:</p>
									<ul>  
										<li>Exponential Moving Averages (EMA): Short-term and medium-term trends were
											captured using two EMAs. These moving averages give more weight to recent price
											movements, making them more responsive to market changes.</li>  
										<li>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): This indicator measures the diference between two EMAs of different time periods, helping to identify buy or sell
											signals. The signal line, a smoothed version of the MACD, is also calculated to provide clearer insights into potential trend reversals.</li>  
										<li>Bollinger Bands: This indicator measures stock price volatility and identifies overbought
											or oversold conditions. The upper and lower bands, which are based on the
											stock’s moving average and standard deviation, are used to assess price extremes.
											The width of the bands reflects market volatility, while the relative position of the
											stock’s price within the bands can signal potential breakout points.</li>  
									  </ul>
									<p>All these indicators were applied consistently across the stocks, allowing for the analysis of
										market trends, volatility, and momentum. This technical data forms the foundation for the
										model, helping to predict future stock price movements based on historical price patterns.</p>

									<h3>Headline Processing & Technical Indicactors</h3>
									<h4>Headline Processing</h4>
									<p>Sentiment analysis of headlines was performed through a three-step process to efficiently
										filter and assess the relevance of news content.</p>
										<figure style="text-align: center;">
											<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
												Headline Processor Pipeline:
											</figcaption>
											<a href="#" class="image">
												<img src="images/headline_processor.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;">
											</a>
										</figure>
									<p>The first step of processing was removing redundant news headlines. Since we scraped
										news titles from multiple sources, several instances of headlines may have reported on
										the same event but with slight variations in wordings. Aside from reducing API costs, we
										wanted to remove duplicates and similarly reported articles to give equal weight to each
										story when passed into the large language model. We utilized an Agglomerative Clustering
										algorithm to facilitate this. After normalizing, each headline was first encoded into vector
										embeddings using a pre-trained language model developed by Microsoft, all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
										The Agglomerative Clustering model used cosine distance to measure similarity to determine
										which headlines were similar to each other. If it passed a certain threshold, 0.7, then
										they formed a cluster in which only one headline from each cluster was saved to pass into
										the large language model next. A threshold of 0.7 was selected to ensure that only highly
										similar headlines were grouped.</p>
									<p>The next step involves determining the relevance of each selected headline to a specific
										sector. Relevance is a relatively straightforward task and can be handled by smaller large
										language models such as Mistral 7b, LLAMA 2-7b, or GPT-4o mini. For this task, we chose
										to use GPT-4o mini. Each headline is passed along with a sector to the model, which then
										classifies whether or not the headline is relevant for predicting price movement for stocks in that sector. Only those headlines deemed relevant are then forwarded to the final layer
										of the analysis.</p>
									<p>In the final step, we assed how the relevant headlines influenced stock prices. All relevant
										headlines were passed together with their corresponding stocks to a more powerful LLM,
										such as GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 Ultra. The model returns a score for each stock, ranging from
										-5 to 5, where -5 indicates strong confidence that the stock will decrease in price based on
										the headline, and 5 indicates strong confidence that the stock will increase in price the
										following day. These sentiment scores are then ready to be used in our final models.</p>
									<h4>Technical Indicactors</h4>
									<p>To predict stock price movements, we developed a technical model that combines traditional
										technical analysis with machine learning methods. Key technical indicators, including
										exponential moving averages (EMA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD),
										and Bollinger Bands, were calculated from the raw price data.</p>
									<p>We calculated a 10-period EMA as well as a 25-period EMA. In general, a 10-period EMA
										captures short-term trends, while a 25-period EMA helps smooth out price fluctuations
										and reveals the medium-term direction. By comparing them, we can identify short-term
										reversals and confirm longer-term trends. More importantly, a crossover between shortterm
										and medium-term EMAs can be interpreted as a signal to buy or sell.</p>
									<p>We calculate the difference between the 12-period EMA and the 26-period EMA for the
										MACD indicator. When the 12-period EMA is higher than the 26-period EMA, it indicates
										bullish momentum, and conversely, when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA,
										it signals bearish momentum. Additionally, we calculated the signal line by applying a 9-period
										EMA to the MACD line. The signal line serves as a trigger for buying or selling when
										the MACD line crosses above or below it.</p>
									<p>Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: a moving average, typically the 5-period simple
										moving average, an upper band, and a lower band. The moving average typically represents
										the stock’s average price over a set period, while the upper and lower bands are calculated by
										adding and subtracting a specified number of standard deviations from the moving average.
										We selected to measure it against 1 standard deviation to be more sensitive to price changes
										as we are predicting for short-term trading. The distance between the upper and lower
										bands expands when the stock becomes more volatile and contracts during periods of low
										volatility. The relative position of the stock price within the bands is also used to gauge
										potential price movements and reversals.</p>
										<p>These indicators were selected due to their ability to capture trends, momentum, volatility
											, and to identify overbought or oversold conditions. The resulting dataset is further
											enhanced by calculating the percentage change in price and adding a target variable that
											represents the next day’s closing price.</p>

									<h3>Technical Model</h3>
									<p>After feature extraction, the data was preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.
										This included aligning stock data with sentiment scores derived from the headline processor,
										which was merged with the stock data on matching dates to create the final dataset. The
										data was split into training and test sets, with 90% of the data allocated for training and
										the remaining 10% used to evaluate the model’s predictive performance.</p>
									<p>The machine learning model used is XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework known
										for its accuracy and efficiency with structured data. The model was trained to minimize
										squared error when predicting the next day’s closing price. After training, the model’s
										performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute
										percentage error (MAPE), and the R-squared value. We also used feature importance to
										identify which technical indicators have the most influence on predictions to refine our
										model. Finally, the trained model is used to predict stock prices for the next three days, and
										the results are compared to actual prices to measure predictive accuracy and percentage
										difference.</p>

									<h3>Results</h3>
									<p>Overall, our research shows that adding sentiment analysis to stock prediction models
										substantially improves accuracy compared to just using technical indicators. Looking at
										all sectors together, predictions that incorporated sentiment had an average error of only
										2.92% versus 4.46% for the technical-only approach, a 34.5% improvement. This confirms
										that market sentiment pulled from news headlines adds real predictive value when combined
										with traditional technical analysis.</p>

										</figure>
									<h4>Sector-Specific Performance</h4>
									<p>Different sectors responded differently to our sentiment analysis, reflecting how industries
										react to news in unique ways. Energy stocks showed the greatest improvement, with
										the error rate decreasing from 4.03% to 2.24%, a 44.4% reduction. This aligns with the
										high sensitivity of energy markets to real-time events, such as geopolitical tensions in the
										Middle East and hurricane forecasts, making timely news especially valuable for prediction.</p>
									<p>Consumer staples saw a 37.8% reduction in error, reflecting their sensitivity to news about
										inflation and consumer confidence. Healthcare followed closely with a 36.1% improvement,
										consistent with how pharmaceutical and biotech stocks respond to FDA announcements,
										clinical trial results, and health policy updates.</p>
									<p>Technology stocks showed the least improvement at 22.7%. This likely reflects the sector’s
										focus on long-term growth and quarterly earnings rather than short-term news cycles.
										While sentiment still plays a role in the technology sector, fundamental analysis and earnings
										projections may carry more weight. The key takeaway is that sentiment analysis should
										be adjusted by sector and that there is no universal approach that works for all industries.</p>
									<h4>Case Study: Abbott Laboratories</h4>
									
									<p>Looking at specific examples really drives home how sentiment improves prediction. We
										tracked Abbott Laboratories (ABT) over three days and saw the following:</p>
									<p>Looking at the specific price predictions over a three-day period, the results demonstrate
										the value of sentiment analysis. On day one, both models performed identically, predicting
										a price of $135.78 compared to the actual closing price of $135.96, a minimal difference of
										18 cents.</p>
										<figure style="text-align: center;">
											<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
												Comparison of actual and predicted stock price over three days for Abbott Laboratories:

												<img src="images/ABT_pred vs. Actual.png" alt="Predicted vs. Actual for ABT" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;">
											</a>

										</figure>
									<p>By the second day, differences between the models became more apparent. While the
										actual price remained relatively stable at $135.87, the sentiment-enhanced model predicted
										$135.29, with a minor deviation of just 58 cents. In contrast, the technical-only model
										showed a larger divergence, estimating $132.50 and undervaluing the actual price by $3.37.</p>
									<p>The most notable divergence occurred on day three when the actual price rose to $138.01.
										The sentiment-enhanced model, accounting for positive market sentiment, predicted $136.25,
										underestimating by only $1.76. In contrast, the technical-only model failed to capture the
										upward movement, predicting a sharp decline to $126.75—$11.26 below the actual price,
										with an error exceeding 8%. This significant gap underscores the limitations of relying
										solely on technical indicators, as they can overlook key market shifts that sentiment analysis
										effectively detects.</p>

									  </table>
									  <p>A closer analysis of daily error rates shows that integrating sentiment analysis consistently
										improves accuracy across different stock groups and time frames. The effect is especially noticeable
										on volatile days. For example, on Day 2, Group 1 stocks had an error rate of 2.81% with sentiment integration, compared to 5.05% without it. A similar pattern appeared in
										Group 3 on Day 3, where sentiment analysis reduced error from 6.14% to 4.42%.</p>
									  <p>Overall, this hybrid approach performs better than traditional models by integrating technical
										analysis with sentiment analysis. This framework enables traders to make better realtime
										decisions that align with both market trends and investor reactions to news.</p>

									<h3>Discussion</h3>
									<p>Initially we did not plan on using any large language models to assess the headlines and
										just use a BERT model to determine if a specific headline is positive or negative about a
										stock. However, we decided not to do this because a BERT model does not have a good
										enough reasoning ability to determine relevance and could not determine if a headline will
										postively or negatively affect a stock and as a whole weigh different types of headlines and
										aggregating them to create a single score.</p>
									<p>One specific challenge that we had was figuring out a good prompt to properly utilize
										the LLM to the best of its ability. Another one was trying to trim the amount of headlines
										to reduce API costs, which is why we decided to create a similarity filter.</p>

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>In this project we built a pipeline to determine stock movement from news headlines and
										historical stock data incorporating tools like Tree Boosting, ChatGPT, and vectorization.
										Our model with headlines performed significantly better than the one without indicating
										headlines is a relevant indicator for short term stock movements. However, it remains to be
										seen whether our headline processor can be used to generate alpha within the stock market
										over a long period of time and with a larger portfolio.</p>
									<p>	Our results display the complexity of predicting within the stock market as even something
										as small as news headlines can have a significant impact on the stock market. This
										makes sense as historically many traders have simply used traditional strategies like technical
										analysis which does not account for what is actually happening in the world. Thus
										the more types of media that can be captured will likely give more indicators to if a stock
										will perform better or worse.</p>
									<p>	Since no comprehensive dataset existed with hourly news headlines paired with stock
										prices, we had to construct our own covering only one month of data. This limited time
										frame makes it difficult to assess the model’s robustness across different market conditions.
										Future work could address this by expanding the dataset to include multiple years of historical
										news data.</p>
